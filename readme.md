Humans-API
----------

Basic implementation of a RESTFul API.

## Description
As described here, _https://github.com/pragmanila/humans-api_, the API should not be implemented using existing micro-frameworks so I create my own. I used the following libraries for my custom framework.

- Router: _https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute_
- Migration: _https://phinx.org/_
- ORM: Laravel's Eloquent

## Usage
For testing purposes, you can run the application using `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000` and access it in your browser using localhost:8000.

Run the front end _ _ to see a demo of API consumption.
